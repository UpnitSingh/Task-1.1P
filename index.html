            <h3>Telephone Ring Detector</h3>
            <p>A telephone ring detector is a device or circuit designed to detect the ringing signal of a telephone line and provide an output that can be used for various purposes, such as triggering other devices or alerting users. This is particularly useful in environments where the standard telephone ring may not be heard, or where additional actions need to be taken when a call is incoming.</p>

            <h3>Electric Toll Tax</h3>
            <p>An electric toll tax system is an automated method of collecting tolls from vehicles as they pass through toll booths or toll roads without requiring drivers to stop and pay manually. Utilizing technologies like RFID tags, transponders, or license plate recognition, the system automatically identifies the vehicle and charges the toll to the driver's account, typically linked to a prepaid balance or credit card. This system enhances efficiency by reducing congestion, lowering operational costs, and minimizing environmental impact by reducing idle times at toll plazas. Electric toll tax systems are widely used on highways and bridges to streamline traffic flow and improve the overall transportation experience.</p>
